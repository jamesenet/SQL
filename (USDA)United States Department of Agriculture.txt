Scenario: 

Data Scientist at USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)


Context: 

You are a Data Scientist working at the USDA. Your department has been tracking the production of various agricultural commodities across different states. 

Your datasets include:

`milk_production`, `cheese_production`, `coffee_production`, `honey_production`, `yogurt_production`, and a `state_lookup` table. 

The data spans multiple years and states, with varying levels of production for each commodity.

Your manager has requested that you generate insights from this data to aid in future planning and decision-making. You'll need to use SQL queries to answer the questions that come up in meetings, reports, or strategic discussions.


Objectives:

Assess state-by-state production for each commodity.

Identify trends or anomalies.

Offer data-backed suggestions for areas that may need more attention.


NOTE: All answer entries are numeric and only numbers and periods. The autograder does not accept commas for the final project.

 AND cp.Period = 'APR'
 AND cp.Year = 2023
 GROUP BY sl.State ;;





Question 3
Your manager wants to know how coffee production has changed over the years.

Correct

SELECT AVG(Value) , Year FROM honey_production hp WHERE Year = 2022;





Question 5
The State Relations team wants a list of all states names with their corresponding ANSI codes. Can you generate that list?

What is the State_ANSI code for Florida?

SELECT * FROM state_lookup sl;





Question 6
For a cross-commodity report, can you list all states with their cheese production values, even if they didn't produce any cheese in April of 2023?

What is the total for NEW JERSEY?


4889000
Correct

SELECT  
 sl.State,
 cp.Value 
FROM state_lookup sl 
LEFT JOIN cheese_production cp 
ON sl.State_ANSI = cp.State_ANSI
WHERE cp.Period = 'APR'
 AND cp.Year = 2023
GROUP BY sl.State ;





Question 7
Can you find the total yogurt production for states in the year 2022 which also have cheese production data from 2023? This will help the Dairy Division in their planning.


1171095000
Correct


SELECT 
SUM(yp.Value) 
FROM yogurt_production yp 
WHERE yp.Year = 2022 
AND yp.State_ANSI IN 
( SELECT DISTINCT cp.State_ANSI FROM cheese_production cp  WHERE cp.Year = 2023 );





Question 8
List all states from state_lookup that are missing from milk_production in 2023.

How many states are there?

26
Correct


SELECT 
 COUNT(DISTINCT sl.State) COUNT_OF_MISSING_MILK_PRODUCTION_STATE_IN_2023
FROM state_lookup sl 
LEFT JOIN milk_production mp 
ON sl.State_ANSI = mp.State_ANSI
 AND mp.Year = 2023
WHERE mp.State_ANSI IS NULL;





Question 9
List all states with their cheese production values, including states that didn't produce any cheese in April 2023.

Yes

No


Correct

SELECT
sl.State 
FROM state_lookup sl 
LEFT JOIN milk_production mp ON sl.State_ANSI = mp.State_ANSI 
WHERE YEAR = 2023 
GROUP BY sl.State ;





Question 10
Find the average coffee production for all years where the honey production exceeded 1 million.


6426666
Correct


SELECT
 AVG(cp.Value) AVERAGE_COFFEE_PRODUCTION
FROM coffee_production cp 
WHERE cp.Year IN (
 SELECT
  hp.Year
 FROM honey_production hp 
 WHERE hp.Value > 1000000
);
